## Info

This repo is setup to enable you to run the ethernaut levels locally rather than on Rinkeby. As a result you will see some contracts that are not related to individual level but instead to ethernaut's core contracts which determine if you have passed the level.

These are the Ethernaut.sol & BaseLevel.sol contracts in the root of ./src and the factory contracts which have a naming convention of [LEVEL_NAME]Factory.sol in each levels repo. Have a read through if interested in what they do otherwise they can be ignored.
